# Haiku generator

Simple Haiku random generator with each verse with a thematic of "morning", "noon" and "afternoon", in order.

---

## Setup

Run the `app.js` with Node

```js
node app.js
```

## Future improvements

1. Change `randomNumGenerator()` so it can scale with any array length.
2. Change the prepared verses from array to object, to divide in one block the verses by theme (morning, noon and afternoon).
